# tRPC-Next-TodoMVC

## What is this?
This is a simple TodoMVC built in Next.js using tRPC for the backend and end-to-end type safety. I built this to improve my familiarity with tRPC and full-stack Next.js.

## Installation
Install dependencies
```
yarn
```

Make sure you have a Postgres database (local or elsewhere)

Create a `.env` file containing the database url (see `.env.sample` for reference)

Start the development server
```
yarn dev
```
